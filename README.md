TWU hosts two separate installations of WordPress; [create.twu.ca](https://create.twu.ca ) and [books.twu.ca](https://books.twu.ca).

Create.twu.ca is a standard WordPress multi-site installation that is available for student, faculty and staff use. Clicking on the link above will take you to a page where you can either sign in or create an account and a new site for yourself. Registrations are limited to those users who have a '...@twu.ca' or a '...@mytwu.ca' email address.

Books.twu.ca is a customized installation utilizing the PressBooks plugin to enable the creation, hosting, and cloning of open textbooks or other books. Please contact colin.madland\[at\]twu\[dot\]ca for assistance.
